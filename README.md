# C-Card_Game_WAR

For your project (20% of your grade), you will use the Card and Deck classes we built this semester. You will implement the card game War.

The games is to be played by one human player against the computer. Ace is high.

The rules of the card game War are as follows:

THE DEAL
The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, dealt one at a time, face down. Anyone may deal first. Each player places their stack of cards face down, in front of them.

THE PLAY
Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card takes both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of his stack.

If the cards are the same rank, it is War. Each player turns up one card face down and one card face up. The player with the higher cards takes both piles (six cards). If the turned-up cards are again the same rank, each player places another card face down and turns another card face up. The player with the higher card takes all 10 cards, and so on.

After each round, the program should ask the user if they want to continue or forfeit. If they forfeit the program should print the number of cards each player has and quit.

HOW TO KEEP SCORE
The game ends when one player has won all the cards.
